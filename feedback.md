## Code Quality - Performing

Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

-   Also, make sure to remove any unused code from your HTML/JS/CSS files and also indent your code properly!

## Technical Requirements - Performing

Renders in browser with no major errors and seperates concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

-   The game works well in the browser! Great job using media queries to make your game responsive.

## Creativity and Interface - Excelling

The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

-   I love the design of your game, especially with the click-and-flip-a-card feature! I thought the theme you chose was really cool and interesting :)

## Presentation - Performing

Application has functional and creative interface and a readme with relevant information about the application.

-   Your readme is informative! I thought the format made sense. However, some of your header formatting seems to be off (e.g., ##Motivation header rendering incorrectly in your readme). Fixing your headings so that they render properly would make the flow of your readme much easier to follow. Take a look at Jared's readme for inspiration: https://github.com/jaredsmorgan/astronomy-memory-game

## Additional Feedback

-   Take a look at some of my inline comments on your code.
-   Take a look at how I've used the prettier plugin to automatically clean up your code formatting!
